# ai-chatbot Component System Documentation

This document provides an overview of the component architecture and UI system used in the `ai-chatbot` Next.js project. It covers the design principles, component hierarchy, reusable UI components, component composition patterns, state management, inter-component communication, and the styling approach.

## 1. Component Hierarchy and Structure

The `ai-chatbot` project employs a modular component structure that encourages reuse and maintains scalability. Components are organized into directories that reflect their purpose and scopeâ€”ranging from individual UI controls to complex feature sets.

### Component Directories:
- **`components/ui`:** Basic UI elements such as buttons, inputs, and modals.
- **`components/app`:** Components specific to the core application features like sidebars and error handlers.
- **`components/auth`:** Authentication-related components, including login forms and authentication handlers.
- **`components/chat`:** Chat-specific components, handling everything from message display to chat inputs.
- **`components/pdf`:** Components that are used to handle PDF viewing and errors.

### Example: Basic UI Component Structure
**File:** `components/ui/button.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
    children: React.ReactNode;
    onClick: () => void;
    className?: string;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, onClick, className }) => (
    <button onClick={onClick} className={`btn ${className}`}>
        {children}
    </button>
);
```

This simple `Button` component is used throughout the application, promoting consistency and reusability.

## 2. Reusable UI Components

Components are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application. They accept props to customize appearance and behavior, ensuring flexibility.

### Best Practices for Reusability:
- **Prop Driven Configuration:** Components behave differently based on props, allowing them to adapt to various contexts.
- **Minimal State:** Keep components stateless where possible, to enhance predictability and reusability.

### Common Pitfall:
- **Over-Configuration:** Providing too many configuration options can make components complex and hard to maintain. Balance flexibility with simplicity.

## 3. Component Composition Patterns

Composition is a core principle in React, and `ai-chatbot` leverages this to build complex UIs from simple components.

### Example: Composing a Form
**File:** `components/auth/auth-form.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Input, Button } from '@/components/ui';

const AuthForm = () => (
    <form>
        <Input label="Username" name="username" type="text" />
        <Input label="Password" name="password" type="password" />
        <Button onClick={() => submitForm()}>Login</Button>
    </form>
);

function submitForm() {
    // Form submission logic
}
```

This form utilizes input and button components, demonstrating how larger components are built from smaller, reusable ones.

## 4. State Management Within Components

State management is handled as locally as possible, with complex state managed via libraries like SWR or Redux for data fetching and cross-component state.

### Example: Using SWR for Data Fetching
**File:** `hooks/use-artifact.ts`
```tsx
import useSWR from 'swr';

export const useArtifact = (id: string) => {
    const { data, error } = useSWR(`/api/artifacts/${id}`);
    return { data, error, isLoading: !error && !data };
};
```
This hook manages the fetching and caching of artifact data, abstracting complex state management away from the UI components.

## 5. How Components Communicate

Inter-component communication in `ai-chatbot` is often facilitated by the global state (using Context API or Redux), props, or callback functions.

### Example: Parent to Child Communication
**Parent Component:**
```tsx
<ChildComponent onDataUpdate={handleDataUpdate} />
```
**Child Component:**
```tsx
const ChildComponent = ({ onDataUpdate }) => {
    onDataUpdate(updatedData);
};
```

## 6. Styling Approach

`ai-chatbot` uses a combination of Tailwind CSS for utility classes and CSS Modules for component-specific styling, providing a balance between consistency and encapsulation.

### Example: Styling with Tailwind and CSS Modules
**CSS Module (button.module.css):**
```css
.button {
    background-color: var(--color-primary);
    padding: 8px 16px;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```
**Component (Button.tsx):**
```tsx
import styles from './button.module.css';

<Button className={styles.button} />
```

This approach ensures that styling is both consistent across the platform and specific enough to avoid unwanted side-effects.
