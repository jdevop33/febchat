# Project Structure Optimization Summary

## Duplicate Directories and Files Removed
- Consolidated `lib/bylaw-processing` and `lib/pdf` into `lib/bylaw/processing`
- Consolidated `lib/vector-search` into `lib/vector`
- Removed duplicate components and updated imports for consistent paths

## Code Organization Improvements

### Consolidated Directories
- **lib/bylaw/processing**: Now contains all bylaw processing functionality (moved from lib/bylaw-processing and lib/pdf)
- **lib/vector**: Now contains all vector search and embedding functionality (merged lib/vector-search)
- **lib/hooks**: Consolidated all custom hooks in a single location
- **components/bylaw**: Consolidated bylaw-related components
- **components/shared**: Common shared components like theme-provider
- **components/chat**: Chat-related components

### Import Path Updates
- Updated all import paths to reflect the new directory structure
- Fixed inconsistent imports to use @/ path alias consistently

### Utility Functions Consolidation
- Enhanced the debounce utility with additional functionality and better documentation
- Unified utility structures for better maintainability

## Cleanup Process
A cleanup script (`cleanup.sh`) has been created to safely remove the now-redundant directories and files after verifying that everything works correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Run the tests to verify all functionality still works correctly
2. Run the cleanup script to remove redundant files 
3. Run linting tools to ensure code style consistency
