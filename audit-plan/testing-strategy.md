# Testing Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the FebChat application.

## 1. Unit Testing

### Core Utilities

- Implement Jest tests for all utility functions
- Focus on pure functions with clear inputs and outputs
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Aim for 90%+ coverage of utility code

### Priority Areas

- Bylaw search utility functions
- Citation formatting and validation
- PDF processing utilities
- Authentication helpers
- Data transformation functions

### Implementation Plan

- Start with existing `enhanced-markdown.test.tsx` as a template
- Create a directory structure mirroring the implementation
- Implement test files with clear naming conventions
- Add test scripts to package.json for running specific test groups

## 2. Component Testing

### UI Components

- Test core UI components with React Testing Library
- Focus on user interactions and accessibility
- Test state changes and side effects
- Ensure responsive behavior works as expected

### Priority Components

- Message components
- Document preview and rendering
- Form inputs and validation
- Buttons and interactive elements
- Navigation components

### Implementation Plan

- Create component test files alongside components
- Use mock data for API responses
- Test user interactions with fireEvent
- Validate accessibility with jest-axe

## 3. Integration Testing

### API Routes

- Test all API endpoints with integration tests
- Verify request validation and error handling
- Test authentication and authorization
- Validate response formats and status codes

### Feature Flows

- Test complete user flows across multiple components
- Validate search and result rendering
- Test chat message creation and response
- Test document creation and editing

### Implementation Plan

- Create dedicated integration test directory
- Use test database for integration tests
- Mock external services
- Run tests in CI pipeline

## 4. End-to-End Testing

### Critical Paths

- Test complete user journeys with Playwright
- Validate core functionality across browsers
- Test error recovery and edge cases
- Validate performance and accessibility

### Priority Flows

- User registration and login
- Chat creation and messaging
- Document creation and editing
- Bylaw search and citation

### Implementation Plan

- Set up Playwright test environment
- Create test scripts for critical user journeys
- Include mobile and desktop viewport testing
- Run tests on multiple browsers in CI

## 5. Performance Testing

### Core Metrics

- Page load time
- Time to interactive
- API response times
- Component render performance

### Implementation Plan

- Add performance monitoring to CI
- Create performance test scripts
- Establish performance budgets
- Set up alerting for performance regressions

## 6. Security Testing

### Areas to Test

- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- API security
- Data protection

### Implementation Plan

- Implement security linting rules
- Add security-focused tests
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## 7. Test Automation

### CI/CD Integration

- Run tests on every pull request
- Block merges for test failures
- Generate test coverage reports
- Track test metrics over time

### Local Development

- Fast feedback loop for developers
- Watch mode for affected tests
- Visual test results
- Test debugging tools

## 8. Testing Tools

- Jest for unit and component testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- MSW for API mocking
- Jest-axe for accessibility testing
