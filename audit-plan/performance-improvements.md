# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the planned performance optimizations for the codebase.

## 1. Caching Strategy

### Current Issues
- Inconsistent caching across API endpoints
- Multiple implementations of similar caching logic
- Some expensive operations lack proper caching

### Planned Improvements
- Implement consistent LRU-cache based caching for all expensive operations
- Add cache invalidation triggers for data updates
- Add cache headers for static assets
- Implement React Query for client-side data fetching with caching

## 2. Component Rendering Optimization

### Current Issues
- Unnecessary re-renders of complex components
- Missing memoization for expensive computations
- Large component trees with prop drilling

### Planned Improvements
- Add React.memo() to pure components with frequent parent re-renders
- Use useMemo() for expensive computations
- Implement useCallback() for functions passed as props
- Add key props with stable identifiers for all list items
- Virtualize large lists with react-window or similar

## 3. API Call Optimization

### Current Issues
- Multiple small API calls that could be batched
- Redundant data fetching
- Missing debounce for user input handlers

### Planned Improvements
- Implement API call batching for related operations
- Add debounce to all search and filter operations
- Prefetch data for likely user actions
- Use SWR's deduplication and stale-while-revalidate pattern

## 4. Database Query Optimization

### Current Issues
- Some queries fetch unnecessary data
- Missing indexes for frequently accessed fields
- Inefficient join operations

### Planned Improvements
- Audit and optimize database queries
- Add appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Consider denormalization for frequently accessed data

## 5. Asset Loading Optimization

### Current Issues
- Large bundle sizes
- Synchronous loading of non-critical resources
- Inefficient loading of PDF documents

### Planned Improvements
- Implement code splitting for large components
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical functionality
- Implement lazy loading for images and media
- Optimize PDF loading with pagination and progressive rendering

## 6. Server-Side Rendering and Caching

### Current Issues
- Inefficient use of React Server Components
- Missing static generation for stable content
- Inconsistent streaming implementations

### Planned Improvements
- Review and optimize React Server Component usage
- Implement proper static generation for stable pages
- Add streaming response handlers for large datasets
- Add Incremental Static Regeneration for semi-dynamic content

## 7. Monitoring and Profiling

### Current Issues
- Limited visibility into runtime performance
- No automated performance regression testing
- Inconsistent error tracking

### Planned Improvements
- Add comprehensive performance monitoring
- Set up performance regression testing in CI
- Implement structured logging for performance metrics
- Create performance dashboards for critical paths
