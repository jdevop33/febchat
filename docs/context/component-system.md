# Component System Documentation

This document provides an overview of the component architecture and user interface (UI) system for the "ai-chatbot" project developed with Next.js. It outlines the structure, patterns, and best practices for managing and developing components, focusing on maintainability and scalability.

## 1. Overview of Component Hierarchy

In the "ai-chatbot" project, components are organized hierarchically within the `components/` directory. This hierarchical organization helps in maintaining a clear structure and makes it easier to navigate the codebase. Components are categorized into several directories reflecting their functionality and usage context:

- `ui/`: Contains reusable UI components like buttons, input fields, and tooltips. These are the basic building blocks used across different parts of the application.
- `chat/`, `documents/`, `bylaw/`: Specific to different domains like chat interfaces, document handling, and bylaw information, respectively.
- `artifacts/`: Related to specific outputs or products generated throughout the system, encapsulating their actions and properties.

### Component Example: Button

```tsx
// components/ui/button.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick} className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
    {children}
  </button>
);
```

## 2. Reusable UI Components

The reusability of components is a key factor in a scalable frontend architecture. Components under the `ui` directory are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application. Each component addresses a single concern and can be configured via props.

### Best Practices for Reusable Components

- **Encapsulation**: Components should manage their own state and logic, exposing only necessary interfaces (props) to the parent components.
- **No side effects**: Pure components are preferable as they do not alter any external state or perform data fetching.
- **Flexibility**: Offering a props interface that supports different use cases for the same component without modifying its internal code.

## 3. Component Composition Patterns

Component composition in React allows developers to build complex UIs out of simpler, reusable components. This project leverages this concept extensively, using composition patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs), render props, and component slots.

### Example: Composing a Modal with Buttons

```tsx
// Using Button and AlertDialog from ui components
import { Button, AlertDialog } from '@/components/ui';

const ConfirmationModal = ({ isOpen, onClose, onConfirm }) => (
  <AlertDialog isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}>
    <p>Are you sure?</p>
    <Button onClick={onConfirm}>Yes</Button>
    <Button onClick={onClose}>No</Button>
  </AlertDialog>
);
```

## 4. State Management within Components

State within components is managed using React's built-in hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`. For global state management or more complex state logic, the project utilizes React Context or state management libraries when necessary.

### Example: Local State in a Form Component

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, Input } from '@/components/ui';

const LoginForm = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = () => {/* Logic to handle submit */};

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <Input value={username} onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder="Username" />
      <Input type="password" value={password} onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="Password" />
      <Button type="submit">Login</Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

## 5. Component Communication

Components communicate primarily through props for parent-child communication and Context for deeper or cross-component communication. This approach helps maintain component isolation and reusability.

### Example: Context for Theme Management

```tsx
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext({ theme: 'light', setTheme: () => {} });

export const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
    {children}
  </ThemeContext.Provider>;
};

export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);
```

## 6. Styling Approach

Styling is achieved using TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with consistency. Components are styled using className props, providing the flexibility to modify their appearance based on the context in which they are used.

### Styling Example with TailwindCSS

```tsx
// Example of using TailwindCSS for styling
<div className="p-4 max-w-sm bg-white rounded-lg border shadow-md">
  <h5 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Component Styling</h5>
  <p className="font-normal text-gray-700">This panel uses utility classes from TailwindCSS for styling.</p>
</div>
```

## Conclusion

The "ai-chatbot" project's component system is designed to offer scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. By adhering to best practices in component design, state management, and styling, it ensures a robust and modular frontend architecture that can grow and evolve over time.
