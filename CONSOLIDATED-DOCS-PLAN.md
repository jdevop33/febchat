# FebChat Documentation Consolidation

This document summarizes the documentation consolidation completed for the FebChat project.

## Consolidation Summary

The documentation has been consolidated from multiple scattered markdown files into a minimal, organized structure of just 5 essential files plus a README.

### Original Documentation Issues

- Multiple overlapping and duplicate files
- Inconsistent organization
- Information spread across too many locations
- Difficult for new developers to navigate

### New Documentation Structure

1. **docs/README.md** - Overview of documentation structure
2. **docs/01-project-overview.md** - Introduction to the project, features, and technologies
3. **docs/02-architecture-development.md** - Architecture details and development workflow
4. **docs/03-deployment.md** - Deployment instructions and production setup
5. **docs/04-features-implementation.md** - Details of key features (PDF management, bylaw search)
6. **docs/05-optimization-troubleshooting.md** - Performance optimizations and troubleshooting

### What Was Removed

- Redundant guides and duplicate information
- Nested folders (/docs/guides/ and /docs/context/)
- Old troubleshooting guides superseded by consolidated guides
- Multiple specific implementation files merged into feature guides

### Benefits of New Structure

- Clear logical organization
- Reduced total number of files from 30+ to just 6
- More maintainable documentation
- Easier for new developers to find information
- No functionality lost - all critical information preserved

## Next Steps

1. As the codebase evolves, maintain this minimal documentation structure
2. Add new information to the appropriate existing files rather than creating new ones
3. Regular documentation review to ensure it remains current
4. Future improvements could include adding a search function or table of contents to the README
