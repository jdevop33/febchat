# FEBChat Debugging and Optimization Strategy

This document outlines a systematic approach to debugging and optimizing the FEBChat application.

## 1. API Call Mapping and Validation

### Purpose

Identify all API endpoints and verify their functionality to ensure robust communication between frontend and backend.

### Implementation

- The `debug-api-endpoints.js` script scans the codebase for all API routes defined in `app/api`
- It identifies HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) for each endpoint
- Generates a test file with functions to validate each endpoint

### Action Items

- [ ] Run API mapping script to identify all endpoints
- [ ] Test critical endpoints manually
- [ ] Fix any failing endpoints
- [ ] Document API response formats

## 2. Component Dependency Analysis

### Purpose

Visualize component relationships and identify circular dependencies that can cause bugs and performance issues.

### Implementation

- The `analyze-component-dependencies.js` script examines import statements
- Creates a visual graph of component dependencies
- Highlights circular dependencies in red

### Action Items

- [ ] Run dependency analyzer
- [ ] Identify circular dependencies
- [ ] Fix component organization issues
- [ ] Refactor problematic components

## 3. Performance Profiling

### Purpose

Identify slow-rendering components and optimize them for better performance.

### Implementation

- The `performance-profiler.js` script instruments key components with performance monitoring
- Records render times and reports them to the console
- Creates backups of original files

### Action Items

- [ ] Profile key components in development
- [ ] Identify components with long render times
- [ ] Optimize slow components with memoization or component splitting
- [ ] Verify improvements with repeated profiling

## 4. End-to-End Testing

### Purpose

Verify the full user flow from login to chat completion to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Implementation

- The `end-to-end-test.js` script tests:
  - User authentication
  - Chat creation
  - AI response
  - Chat history
  - Artifact creation
  - Bylaw search

### Action Items

- [ ] Run E2E test to verify full application flow
- [ ] Fix any broken user flows
- [ ] Add tests for additional user journeys
- [ ] Integrate with CI pipeline for automated testing

## 5. Circular Dependency Resolution

### Purpose

Automatically fix circular dependencies by extracting shared types into a central location.

### Implementation

- The `fix-circular-deps.js` script:
  - Extracts types from components with circular dependencies
  - Moves them to a shared types file
  - Updates imports to reference the shared types

### Action Items

- [ ] Run circular dependency fixer
- [ ] Review generated files
- [ ] Apply fixes if they look good
- [ ] Test application after fixes

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. Run dependency analyzer to identify circular dependencies
2. Run API mapping to understand endpoint structure
3. Profile components to identify performance bottlenecks

### Phase 2: Fixes

1. Apply circular dependency fixes
2. Optimize slow components
3. Fix any API issues

### Phase 3: Verification

1. Run end-to-end tests to verify fixes
2. Re-run profiling to confirm performance improvements
3. Monitor application in development

## Conclusion

This systematic approach will help you identify and fix issues methodically, ensuring your app is robust and performant. Each script provides visibility into different aspects of your application, from API endpoints to component dependencies and performance bottlenecks.

By following this strategy, you'll be able to quickly identify and resolve issues, leading to a more stable and efficient application for your users.
