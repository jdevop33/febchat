# FebChat Security & Quality Improvements

This document outlines security improvements, best practices, and quality enhancements implemented to ensure FebChat follows modern development standards.

## Security Improvements

### Authentication

- **Stronger Password Requirements**: Implemented stricter password validation with minimum 8 characters, requiring uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Session Security**: Reduced JWT session length from 30 days to 24 hours for better security
- **Rate Limiting**: Added rate limiting middleware to protect against brute force attacks and API abuse
- **Secure Cookies**: Enhanced cookie security with HttpOnly, SameSite, and secure flags
- **Authentication Error Page**: Added a dedicated error page with better user feedback for authentication failures

### API Security

- **Path-Based Protection**: Improved route protection with clearer rules for public vs. protected paths
- **Token Validation**: Enhanced JWT token handling with better expiration management
- **Custom Error Handling**: Implemented standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Accessibility Improvements

- **ARIA Attributes**: Added proper ARIA roles, labels, and descriptions to components
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Improved keyboard navigation for chat interface, including better focus management
- **Screen Reader Support**: Added screen reader text and instructions for complex interactions
- **Focus States**: Enhanced visual focus indicators for interactive elements
- **Form Accessibility**: Improved form inputs with proper labels and descriptions

## Performance Enhancements

- **Optimized Renders**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders in components
- **Efficient DOM Operations**: Improved textarea height calculation approach
- **Better Memoization**: Enhanced component memoization with proper dependency checks

## Code Quality Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with custom error classes and more descriptive messages
- **Type Safety**: Reduced usage of 'any' types in favor of proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized form validation and API response handling

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Email Verification**: Implement email verification flow for new user registrations
2. **CSRF Protection**: Add explicit CSRF token validation for sensitive form submissions
3. **Content Security Policy**: Implement a strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
4. **Database Indexing**: Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes
5. **API Documentation**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for API endpoints
6. **Automated Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for critical components
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Add client-side and server-side performance monitoring
8. **Security Headers**: Implement additional security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
9. **Regular Dependency Updates**: Establish a workflow for regular dependency updates and security patches

## Conclusion

The implemented improvements significantly enhance the security, accessibility, and performance of FebChat. These changes follow modern best practices for Next.js applications and establish a solid foundation for future development.
